## What it is
This project is the last group project of our formation at BeCode and we used a provided template to start working on it. We have to provide a fully functionning website which will allow its users to log in and log out, create an account as well as manage the data that have been added by the administrator itself. The dashboard will allow all these operations (CRUD). For more informations on the way you can use the project, please look at the section below.

## Installation

This project will require you to use a database. You will find its template in the ```database``` folder of this repository. You can download it and use it, but you will need to introduce your own data inside of it if you want to make.

This project also uses environment variables to allow you to access the database. You will have to run ```composer install```to install the required dependencies. Then, you can create the necessary ```.env``` file using the ```.env.example```provided in the project. The required fields are the following.

> - The database name
> - The host name
> - The username
> - The password
